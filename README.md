Kafka-Storm-Example
===================

This project demonstrated the Kafka and Storm Integration.

To test, execute SimpleProducer class. It produces streams of "I love #Windows " preceded by version. This will be the producer.

For consuming messages and processing and further generating a report, we will execute a topology which will keep on executing.
Execute the KafkaTopology class. We have defined bolts here which are basically operations we want to perform on streams of data.
