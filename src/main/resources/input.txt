Storm has a simple and easy to use API. When programming on Storm, you manipulate and transform streams of tuples, 
and a tuple is a named list of values. Tuples can contain objects of any type; if you want to use a type Storm doesn’t 
know about it’s very easy to register a serializer for that type.

There are just three abstractions in Storm: spouts, bolts, and topologies. A spout is a source of streams in a 
computation. Typically a spout reads from a queueing broker such as Kestrel, RabbitMQ, or Kafka, but a spout can 
also generate its own stream or read from somewhere like the Twitter streaming API. Spout implementations already 
exist for most queueing systems.
